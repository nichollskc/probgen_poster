  abstract = {Identifying latent structure in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for exploring biological processes. Here, we consider recovering gene co-expression networks from gene expression data, where each network encodes relationships between genes that are co-regulated by shared biological mechanisms. To do this, we develop a Bayesian statistical model for biclustering to infer subsets of co-regulated genes that covary in all of the samples or in only a subset of the samples. Our biclustering method, BicMix, allows overcomplete representations of the data, computational tractability, and joint modeling of unknown confounders and biological signals. Compared with related biclustering methods, BicMix recovers latent structure with higher precision across diverse simulation scenarios as compared to state-of-the-art biclustering methods. Further, we develop a principled method to recover context specific gene co-expression networks from the estimated sparse biclustering matrices. We apply BicMix to breast cancer gene expression data and to gene expression data from a cardiovascular study cohort, and we recover gene co-expression networks that are differential across ER+ and ER- samples and across male and female samples. We apply BicMix to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pilot data, and we find tissue specific gene networks. We validate these findings by using our tissue specific networks to identify trans-eQTLs specific to one of four primary tissues.},

We propose a novel generative approach for biclustering called `FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition'. FABIA is based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also captures heavytailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic data.

The majority of discoveries have uncovered cis eQTL effects via mass univariate testing of SNPs against gene expression in single tissues. We present a Bayesian method for multi-tissue experiments focusing on uncovering gene networks linked to genetic variation. Our method decomposes the 3D array (or tensor) of gene expression measurements into a set of latent components. We identify sparse gene networks, which can then be tested for association against genetic variation genome-wide. We apply our method to a dataset of 845 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort with gene expression measured via RNA sequencing in adipose, LCLs and skin. We uncover several gene networks with a genetic basis and clear biological and statistical significance. Extensions of this approach will allow integration of multi-omic, environmental and phenotypic datasets.},

  abstract = {The comparison of ordinary partitions of a set of objects is well established in the clustering literature, which comprehends several studies on the analysis of the properties of similarity measures for comparing partitions. However, similarity measures for clusterings are not readily applicable to biclusterings, since each bicluster is a tuple of two sets (of rows and columns), whereas a cluster is only a single set (of rows). Some biclustering similarity measures have been defined as minor contributions in papers which primarily report on proposals and evaluation of biclustering algorithms or comparative analyses of biclustering algorithms. The consequence is that some desirable properties of such measures have been overlooked in the literature. We review 14 biclustering similarity measures. We define eight desirable properties of a biclustering measure, discuss their importance, and prove which properties each of the reviewed measures has. We show examples drawn and inspired from important studies in which several biclustering measures convey misleading evaluations due to the absence of one or more of the discussed properties. We also advocate the use of a more general comparison approach that is based on the idea of transforming the original problem of comparing biclusterings into an equivalent problem of comparing clustering partitions with overlapping clusters.},

IMPC mouse clinics worldwide follow rigorous highly structured and standardized protocols for the experimentation, collection and dissemination of data. Dedicated `data wranglers' work with each phenotyping center to collate data and perform quality control of data. An automated statistical analysis pipeline has been developed to identify knockout strains with a significant change in the phenotype parameters. Annotation with biomedical ontologies allows biologists and clinicians to easily find mouse strains with phenotypic traits relevant to their research. Data integration with other resources will provide insights into mammalian gene function and human disease. As phenotype data become available for every gene in the mouse, the IMPC web portal will become an invaluable tool for researchers studying the genetic contributions of genes to human diseases.},

The motivating application is the search for interpretable biological structure in gene expression microarray data. Eisen, Spellman, Brown \& Botstein (1998) is an early and inuential paper advocating the use of cluster methods to identify groups of co-regulated genes from microarray data. We present the model and illustrate it on gene expression and other data. The plaid model allows a gene to be in more than one cluster, or in none at all. It also allows a cluster of genes to be dened with respect to only a subset of samples, not necessarily with respect to all of them. Thus for example so...},

  abstract = {Biclustering methods aim to group samples using only subsets of their associated features. In this way, biclustering methods differ from traditional clustering methods, which utilize the entire set of features to group samples. Motivating applications for biclustering include genomics data, where the goal is to cluster patients or samples by their gene expression profiles; and recommender systems, which seek to group customers based on their product preferences. Biclusters of interest often manifest as rank1 submatrices of the data matrix. This submatrix detection problem can be viewed as a factor analysis problem in which both the factors and loadings are sparse. In this paper, we propose a new biclustering method called Spike-and-Slab Lasso Biclustering (SSLB) which utilizes the Spike-and-Slab Lasso of Ro\v{c}kov\'a and George (2018) to find such a sparse factorization of the data matrix. SSLB also incorporates an Indian Buffet Process prior to automatically choose the number of biclusters. Many biclustering methods make assumptions about the size of the latent biclusters; either assuming that the biclusters are all of the same size, or that the biclusters are very large or very small. In contrast, SSLB can adapt to find biclusters which have a continuum of sizes. SSLB is implemented via a fast EM algorithm with a variational step. In a variety of simulation settings, SSLB outperforms other biclustering methods. We apply SSLB to both a microarray dataset and a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset and highlight that SSLB can recover biologically meaningful structures in the data. The SSLB software is available as an R/C++ package at https://github.com/gemoran/SSLB.},

Unlike the classical nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, this new model, denoted ``nonsmooth nonnegative matrix factorization'' (nsNMF), corresponds to the optimization of an unambiguous cost function designed to explicitly represent sparseness, in the form of nonsmoothness, which is controlled by a single parameter. In general, this method produces a set of basis and encoding vectors that are not only capable of representing the original data, but they also extract highly localized patterns, which generally lend themselves to improved interpretability. The properties of this new method are illustrated with several data sets. Comparisons to previously published methods show that the new nsNMF method has some advantages in keeping faithfulness to the data in the achieving a high degree of sparseness for both the estimated basis and the encoding vectors and in better interpretability of the factors.},
